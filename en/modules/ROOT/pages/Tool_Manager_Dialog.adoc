====

User defined tools are saved as files with the file name extension GGT so you can distinguish custom tool files from
usual GeoGebra files (GGB).

This dialog also allows you to remove or modify tools. If you decide to modify a tool, a new GeoGebra window appears.
The input objects are listed as free objects in it. If you have finished your changes, you can save the tool via option

overwrite the tool. To overwrite a tool which was already used, the types of input and output objects must stay the
same.
