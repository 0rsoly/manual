== [#Automatic_Animation]#Automatic Animation#

GeoGebra allows you to animate not only free numbers and/or angles at the same time, but also dependent points that are
constrained on an object (segment, line, function, curve, etc.). In order to be automatically animated, free numbers /
angles need to be shown as sliders in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View].

If you want to animate a free number or angle in GeoGebra, as well as a dependent point, you need to select _Animation
On_ in the xref:/Context_Menu.adoc[Context Menu] of that number, angle or point. In order to stop the animation, you
need to un-check _Animation On_ in the same context menu.

[NOTE]

====

After animating a free number, a free angle or a dependent point, an animation button appears in the lower left corner
of the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_. It allows you
to either image:18px-Nav_pause_circle.svg.png[Nav pause circle.svg,width=18,height=18] pause or
image:18px-Nav_play_circle.svg.png[Nav play circle.svg,width=18,height=18] continue an animation.

====

In the image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties
Dialog] on tab _Slider_ you can change the behavior of the animation:

On the one hand, you may control the _Speed_ of the animation.

[NOTE]

====

A speed of 1 means that the animation takes about 10 seconds to run once through the interval of the slider.

====

On the other hand, you can decide how the animation cycle is repeated:

⇔ _Oscillating_::
  +
  The animation cycle alternates between Decreasing and Increasing.
⇒ _Increasing_::
  +
  The slider value is always increasing. After reaching the maximum value of the slider, it jumps back to the minimum
  value and continues the animation.
⇐ _Decreasing_::
  +
  The slider value is always decreasing. After reaching the minimum value of the slider, it jumps back to the maximum
  value and continues the animation.
⇒ _Increasing_ (_Once_)::
  +
  The slider value is always increasing. After reaching the maximum value of the slider, it stops at this value and ends
  the animation.

[NOTE]

====

while an automatic animation is activated, GeoGebra remains fully functional. This allows you to make changes to your
construction while the animation is playing.

====

== [#Manual_Animation]#Manual Animation#

To manually change a number, angle or point position continuously, select the image:20px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode
move.svg,width=20,height=20]xref:/tools/Move_Tool.adoc[Move Tool]. Then, click on a free number, angle or a dependent
point and press either the [.kcode]#+# or [.kcode]#–# key or the arrow keys on you keyboard. Keeping one of these keys
pressed allows you to produce manual animations.

[EXAMPLE]

====

If the point coordinates depend on a number _t_ like in P = (2 t, t), the point will move along a straight line when _t_
is changed continuously.

====

[NOTE]

====

You can adjust the increment of the slider on tab _Slider_ of the
image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] _Properties Dialog_ of this object.

* [.kcode]#Shift# + arrow key gives you a step width of 0.1 units
* [.kcode]#Ctrl# + arrow key gives you a step width of 10 units
* [.kcode]#Alt# + arrow key gives you a step width of 100 units

[NOTE]

====

A point on a line can also be moved along that line using the [.kcode]#+# or [.kcode]#–# key.
