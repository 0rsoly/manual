Union( <List>, <List> )::
  Joins the two lists and removes elements that appear multiple times.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++Union( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {3, 2, 1, 7} )++` yields `++{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}++`.

====

Union( <Polygon>, <Polygon> )::
  Finds the union of the two polygons. Works only for where the polygons are not self-intersecting, and where the union
  is a single polygon.
