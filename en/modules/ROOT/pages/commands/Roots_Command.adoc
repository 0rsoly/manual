= Roots Command

Roots( <Function>, <Start x-Value>, <End x-Value> )::
  Calculates the roots for function in the given interval. The function must be continuous on that interval. Because
  this algorithm is numeric, it may not find all the roots in some cases.

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:*

`Roots(f, -2, 1)` with the function `f(x) = 3x³ + 3x² - x` yields `A = (-1.264, 0), B = (0, 0), C = (0.264, 0)`
