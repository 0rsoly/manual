= NDerivative Command

NDerivative( <Function> )::
  Plots the 1st derivative of the given function, calculated numerically.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++NDerivative(x^4+2x^3-2x+1)++` plots in _Graphics View_ the graph of the function f(x) = 4x³ + 6x² - 2, which is the
first derivative of the given function. However, the equation of the plotted function is not shown in _Algebra View_.

====

NDerivative( <Function>, <Order n> )::
  Plots the nth derivative of the given function, calculated numerically.
