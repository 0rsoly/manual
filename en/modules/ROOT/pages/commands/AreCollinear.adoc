AreCollinear( <Point>, <Point>, <Point> )::
  Decides if the points are collinear.

Normally this command computes the result numerically. This behavior can be changed by using the
xref:/commands/Prove.adoc[Prove] command.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++AreCollinear((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))++` yields _true_ since all the three points lying on the same line.
