FitPoly( <List of Points>, <Degree of Polynomial> )::
  Calculates the regression polynomial of degree _n_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FitPoly({(-1, -1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 5)}, 3)++` yields _f(x) = x^3^ - 1 x^2^ + 1_.

====

FitPoly( <Freehand Function>, <Degree of Polynomial> )::
  Calculates the regression polynomial of degree _n_ for a function drawn by the
  xref:/tools/Freehand_Shape.adoc[Freehand Shape Tool].

== CAS Syntax

FitPoly( <List of Points>, <Degree of Polynomial> )::
  Calculates the regression polynomial of degree _n_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FitPoly({(-1, -1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 5)}, 3)++` yields _x^3^ - x^2^ + 1_.

[NOTE]
====

* For order _n_ there must be at least _n + 1_ Points in the list.
* See also xref:/commands/FitExp.adoc[FitExp Command], xref:/commands/FitLog.adoc[FitLog Command],
xref:/commands/FitPow.adoc[FitPow Command] and xref:/commands/FitSin.adoc[FitSin Command].
* If you work with big/small numbers, you should consider normalizing them for a more accurate result, see
xref:/commands/Normalize.adoc[Normalize Command].
