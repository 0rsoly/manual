FitGrowth( <List of Points> )::
  Calculates a function of the form stem:[ a b ^ x ] to the points in the list. (Very similar to
  xref:/commands/FitExp.adoc[FitExp][ <List of Points> ], just in a slightly different form).

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FitGrowth({(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3), (6, 4)})++` yields _1.31_ stem:[ \cdot ] _1.23^x^_.

====

[NOTE]
====

* You can do a direct least-squares fitting with `++Fit(list, a*b^x)++`
