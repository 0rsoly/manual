= AreCongruent Command

AreCongruent( <Object>, <Object> )::
  Decides if the objects are congruent.

Normally this command computes the result numerically. This behavior can be changed by using the
xref:/commands/Prove.adoc[Prove] command.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++AreCongruent(Circle((0, 0),1),x^2+y^2=1)++` and `++AreCongruent(Circle((1, 1),1),x^2+y^2=1)++` yield _true_ since the
two circles have the same radius.
