TurtleBack( <Turtle>, <Distance> )::
  The turtle moves back with given distance.

[EXAMPLE]
====

If the turtle is at the origin of the coordinates and the image:Animate_Pause.png[Animate Pause.png,width=16,height=16]
_Pause_ button is displayed the command `++TurtleBack(turtle, 2)++` moves the turtle to the point (-2, 0). Otherwise you
must press the image:Animate_Play.png[Animate Play.png,width=16,height=16] _Play_ button so that the displacement is
effected.
