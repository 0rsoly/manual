ArePerpendicular( <Line>, <Line> )::
  Decides if the lines are perpendicular.

  Normally this command computes the result numerically. This behavior can be changed by using the
  xref:/commands/Prove.adoc[Prove] command.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++ArePerpendicular(Line((-1, 0), (0, -1)), Line((0, 0),(2,2)))++` yields _true_ since the given lines are
perpendicular.
