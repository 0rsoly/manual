= AreEqual Command

AreEqual( <Object>, <Object> )::
  Decides if the objects are equal.

Normally this command computes the result numerically. This behavior can be changed by using the
xref:/commands/Prove_Command.adoc[Prove] command.

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* `AreEqual(Circle((0, 0),1),x^2+y^2=1)` yields _true_ since the two circles have the same center and radius.

====

[NOTE]

====

*Notes:*

* `AreEqual(Segment((1, 2), (3, 4)), Segment((3, 4), (1, 6)))` is different from
`Segment((1, 2), (3, 4)) == Segment((3, 4), (1, 6))` as the latter compares just the lengths
