= Mod Command

Mod( <Dividend Number>, <Divisor Number> )::
  Yields the remainder when dividend number is divided by divisor number.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

`Mod(9, 4)` yields _1_.

====

Mod( <Dividend Polynomial>, <Divisor Polynomial> )::
  Yields the remainder when the dividend polynomial is divided by the divisor polynomial.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

`Mod(x^3 + x^2 + x + 6, x^2 - 3)` yields _4 x + 9_.

====

[NOTE]

====

If you want a function to do this, you can define it yourself, e.g. `mod(x, y) = y (x / y - floor(x / y))`.
