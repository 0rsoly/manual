FitSin( <List of Points> )::
  Calculates the regression curve in the form _a + b sin (c x + d)_.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FitSin({(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 1), (6, 2)})++` yields _f(x) = 1 + 1 sin (1.57 x - 1.57)_.

====

[NOTE]
====

* The list should have at least four points, preferably more. The list should cover at least two extremal points. The
first two local extremal points should not be too different from the absolute extremal points of the curve.
* See also xref:/commands/FitExp.adoc[FitExp Command], xref:/commands/FitLog.adoc[FitLog Command],
xref:/commands/FitPoly.adoc[FitPoly Command] and xref:/commands/FitPow.adoc[FitPow Command].
* If you work with big/small numbers, you should consider normalizing them for a more accurate result, see
xref:/commands/Normalize.adoc[Normalize Command].
