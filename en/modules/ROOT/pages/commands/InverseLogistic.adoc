= InverseLogistic Command

InverseLogistic( <Mean>, <Scale>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of the
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution[Logistic distribution] at probability _p_, where the Logistic
  distribution is given by mean _μ_ and scale _s_.
  +
  In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X ≤ t) = p_, where _X_ is a Logistic random variable.
  +
  Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
