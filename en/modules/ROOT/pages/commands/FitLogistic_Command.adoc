= FitLogistic Command

FitLogistic( <List of Points> )::
  Calculates the regression curve in the form a/(1 + b e^(-kx)).
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* `FitLogistic({(-6, 2), (0, 2), (3, 4), (3.4, 8)})` yields stem:[ \frac\{1.98}\{1 - 0.03 e^\{1x}}].

====

[NOTE]

====

*Note:*

* The first and last data points should be fairly close to the curve. The list should have at least 3 points, preferably
more.
