= Axes Command

Axes( <Conic> )::
  Returns the equations of the major and minor axes of a conic section.

[NOTE]

====

See also xref:/commands/MajorAxis_Command.adoc[MajorAxis] and xref:/commands/MinorAxis_Command.adoc[MinorAxis] commands.

====

Axes( <Quadric> )::
  Creates the 3 axes of the given quadric.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

`Axes(x^2 + y^2 + z^2= 3)` returns the three lines

_a_: _X_ = (0, 0, 0) + _λ_ (1, 0, 0), _b_: _X_ = (0, 0, 0) + _λ_ (0, 1, 0) and _c_: _X_ = (0, 0, 0) + _λ_ (0, 0, 1)

====

[NOTE]

====

*Notes:* Specifically:

* if the given quadric is a _cylinder_, the command yields the two axes of the bottom circle and the rotation axis.
* if the given quadric is a _sphere_, the command yields the three axes parallel to the coordinate system axes.
