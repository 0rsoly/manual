= AreParallel Command

AreParallel( <Line>, <Line> )::
  Decides if the lines are parallel.

Normally this command computes the result numerically. This behavior can be changed by using the
xref:/commands/Prove.adoc[Prove] command.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++AreParallel(Line[(1, 2), (3, 4)), Line((5, 6),(7,8)))++` yields _true_ since the given lines are parallel.
