Shear( <Object>, <Line>, <Ratio> )::
  Shears the object so that
  * points on the line stay fixed.
  * points at distance _d_ from the line are shifted by _d stem:[\cdot] ratio_ in direction of the line (direction of
  the shift is different for halfplanes with respect to the line).
  A sheared plane figure maintains its original area.
