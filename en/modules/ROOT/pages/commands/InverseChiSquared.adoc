= InverseChiSquared Command

InverseChiSquared( <Degrees of Freedom>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution[Chi
  squared distribution] at probability _p_, where the Chi squared distribution has given _d_ degrees of freedom.
  +
  In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X â‰¤ t) = p_, where _X_ is Chi squared random variable.
  +
  Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
