  Decides if the objects are congruent.

Normally this command computes the result numerically. This behavior can be changed by using the
link:/en/Prove_Command[Prove] command.

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* `AreCongruent(Circle((0, 0),1),x^2+y^2=1)` and `AreCongruent(Circle((1, 1),1),x^2+y^2=1)` yield _true_ since
the two circles have the same radius.
