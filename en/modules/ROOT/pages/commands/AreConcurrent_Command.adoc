= AreConcurrent Command

AreConcurrent( <Line>, <Line>, <Line> )::
  Decides if the lines are concurrent. If the lines are parallel, they considered to have a common point in infinity,
  thus this command returns _true_ in this case.

Normally this command computes the result numerically. This behavior can be changed by using the
xref:/commands/Prove_Command.adoc[Prove] command.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`AreConcurrent(Line((1, 2), (3, 4)), Line((1, 2), (3, 5)), Line((1, 2), (3, 6)))` yields _true_ since all three lines
contain the point (1,2).
