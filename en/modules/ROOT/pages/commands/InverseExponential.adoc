InverseExponential( <Lambda>, <Probability> )::
  Computes the inverse of cumulative distribution function of
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution[exponential distribution] at probability _p_, where the
  exponential distribution is given by Lambda.
  In other words, finds _t_ such that _P(X â‰¤ t) = p_, where _X_ is exponential random variable.
  Probability _p_ must be from [0,1].
