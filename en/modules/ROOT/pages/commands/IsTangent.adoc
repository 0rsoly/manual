IsTangent( <Line>, <Conic> )::
  Decides if the line is tangent to the conic.

Normally this command computes the result numerically. This behavior can be changed by using the
xref:/commands/Prove.adoc[Prove] command.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++IsTangent(Line((0,0),(1,0)),Circle((0,1),1))++` yields _true_.
