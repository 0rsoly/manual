AreConcyclic( <Point>, <Point>, <Point>, <Point> )::
  Decides if the points are concyclic.

Normally this command computes the result numerically. This behavior can be changed by using the
xref:/commands/Prove_Command.adoc[Prove] command.

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* `AreConcyclic((1, 2), (3, 4), (1, 4), (3, 2))` yields _true_ since the points are lying on the same circle.
