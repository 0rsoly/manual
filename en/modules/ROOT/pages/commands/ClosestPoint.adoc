= ClosestPoint Command

ClosestPoint( <Path>, <Point> )::
  Returns a new point on a xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[path] which is the closest to a selected point.

[NOTE]
====

For xref:/Functions.adoc[Functions], this command now uses closest point (rather than vertical point). This works best
for polynomials; for other functions the numerical algorithm is less stable.

====

ClosestPoint( <Line>, <Line> )::
  Returns a new point on the first line which is the closest to the second line.
