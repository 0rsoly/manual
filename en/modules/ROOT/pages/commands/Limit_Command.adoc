= Limit Command

Limit( <Function>, <Value> )::
  Computes the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function[limit] of the function for the given value of the main
  function variable. (This may also yield infinity.)

[EXAMPLE]
====

`Limit((x^2 + x) /  x^2, +âˆž)` yields _1_.

====

[NOTE]
====

Not all limits can be calculated by GeoGebra, so _undefined_ will be returned in those cases (as well as when the
correct result is undefined).

Limit( <Expression>, <Value> )::
  Computes the limit of the expression for the given value of the main function variable.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`Limit(a sin(x) / x, 0)` yields _a_.

====

Limit( <Expression>, <Variable>, <Value> )::
  Computes the limit of the expression for the given value of the given function variable.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`Limit(a sin(v) / v, v, 0)` yields _a_.

* Not all limits can be calculated by GeoGebra, so _?_ will be returned in those cases (as well as when the correct
result is undefined).
* If you want the limit of a xref:/commands/If_Command.adoc[piecewise-defined function] you need to use
xref:/commands/LimitAbove_Command.adoc[LimitAbove] or xref:/commands/LimitBelow_Command.adoc[LimitBelow], for example
`LimitAbove(If(x>1, x^2, -2x), 1)`
* See also xref:/commands/Asymptote_Command.adoc[Asymptote Command], xref:/commands/LimitAbove_Command.adoc[LimitAbove
Command] and xref:/commands/LimitBelow_Command.adoc[LimitBelow Command].
