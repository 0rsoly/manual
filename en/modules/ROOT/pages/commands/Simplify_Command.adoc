= Simplify Command

Simplify( <Function> )::
  Simplifies the terms of the given function, if possible.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* `Simplify(x + x + x)` yields the function _f(x) = 3x_.

====

Simplify( <Text> )::
  Attempts to tidy up text expressions by removing repeated negatives etc.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* For _a_ = _b_ = _c_ = -1 `Simplify("f(x) = " + a + "xÂ² + " + b + "x + " + c)` yields the text _f(x) = -x^2^ -
x - 1_.

====

[NOTE]

====

*Note:*

The xref:/commands/FormulaText_Command.adoc[FormulaText Command] normally produces better results and is simpler.

*Note:*

This command needs to load the Computer Algebra System, so can be slow on some computers. Try using the
xref:/commands/Polynomial_Command.adoc[Polynomial Command] instead.

Simplify( <Function> )::
  Simplifies the terms of the given function, if possible. Undefined variables can be included in the terms.

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Examples:*

* `Simplify(3 * x + 4 * x + a * x)` yields ` a x + 7x`.
* `Assume(x<2,Simplify(sqrt(x-2sqrt(x-1))))` yields `-sqrt(abs(x - 1)) + 1`
* `Assume(x>2,Simplify(sqrt(x-2sqrt(x-1))))` yields `sqrt(x - 1) + 1`
