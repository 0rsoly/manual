= Functions

To enter a function you can use previously defined variables (e.g. numbers, points, vectors) as well as other functions.

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:*

* Function f: `f(x) = 3 x^3 – x^2`
* Function g: `g(x) = tan(f(x))`
* Nameless function: `sin(3 x) + tan(x)`

====

[NOTE]

====

*Note:* All available predefined functions (e.g. sin, cos, tan) are described in section
xref:/Predefined_Functions_and_Operators.adoc[Predefined Functions and Operators].

====

In GeoGebra you can also use commands to get for example, the xref:/commands/Integral_Command.adoc[integral] and
xref:/commands/Derivative_Command.adoc[derivative] of a function. You can use xref:/commands/If_Command.adoc[If Command]
to get xref:/Conditional_Functions.adoc[Conditional Functions].

[NOTE]

====

*Note:* You can also use the commands f'(x) or f''(x), … in order to get the derivatives of a previously defined
function f(x).

====

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* Define function _f_ as `f(x) = 3 x^3 – x^2`. Then, you can type in `g(x) = cos(f' (x + 2))` in order to get
function _g_.

====

Furthermore, functions can be translated by a vector (see xref:/commands/Translate_Command.adoc[Translate Command]) and
a free function can be moved by using the image:22px-Mode_move.svg.png[Mode
move.svg,width=22,height=22]xref:/tools/Move_Tool.adoc[Move Tool]. Other
xref:/commands/Transformation_Commands.adoc[Transformation Commands] can be also applied to functions, but in most cases
the result is not a function but a curve.

== [#Limit_Function_to_Interval]#Limit Function to Interval#

In order to limit a function to an interval [a, b], you need to use the xref:/commands/Function_Command.adoc[Function
Command] or the xref:/commands/If_Command.adoc[If Command].

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* `If[3<=x<=5,x^2]` and `Function[x^2,3,5]` both define a function _x^2^_ restricted to interval [3,5]
