= Object Properties

Following properties can be set via image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties Dialog].

== [#Visibility]#Visibility#

You may show or hide objects in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View] in different ways.

* You may use tool image:20px-Mode_showhideobject.svg.png[Mode showhideobject.svg,width=20,height=20]
xref:/tools/Show_Hide_Object_Tool.adoc[Show_/_Hide Object Tool] to show or hide objects.
* Open the xref:/Context_Menu.adoc[Context Menu] and select item image:20px-Mode_showhideobject.svg.png[Mode
showhideobject.svg,width=20,height=20] _Show Object_ to change the visibility status of the selected object.
* In the image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Algebra_View.adoc[Algebra
View], the icon to the left of every object shows its current visibility state (shown or hidden). You may directly click
on the little marble icon in order to change the visibility status of an object.
* You can also use the image:20px-Mode_showcheckbox.svg.png[Mode showcheckbox.svg,width=20,height=20]
xref:/tools/Check_Box_Tool.adoc[Check Box Tool] in order to show or hide one or several objects.

[NOTE]

====

To make an object "invisible" in the image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view algebra.svg,width=16,height=16]
_Algebra View_, make it xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[Auxiliary].

====

== [#Fixed_objects]#Fixed objects#

You can define an object to be fixed via image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16]
_Properties Dialog_. Fixed objects (both xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[free and dependent]) cannot be
moved. To stop an object being selected / deleted you can uncheck its "Selection Allowed" option in the Advanced Tab.

== [#Filling]#Filling#

For closed xref:/Curves.adoc[Curves] and xref:/Geometric_Objects.adoc[regions] you can specify filling using the _Style_
tab of image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] _Object properties dialog_. There are three
types of filling:

Standard::
  Fills the object by color specified in the _Color_ tab. The same color is used to draw border of that object. Using
  _Style_ tab you can define opacity -- e.g. Conics have by default opacity 0 which means they are transparent.
Hatching::
  The object is hatched, angle of hatches and distance between them can be specified. Thickness of hatches equals the
  thickness of object's border.
Cross-hatching::
  The object is cross-hatched (available angle for hatches: 0째 - 45째) and the distance between lines can be specified.
  Thickness of hatches equals the thickness of object's border.
Chessboard::
  Fills the object using a chessboard pattern (available angle for squares: 0째 - 45째). The squares' heights can be
  specified.
Dots::
  Fills the object using a dotted pattern, distance between dots can be specified.
Honeycomb::
  Fills the object using a honeycomb pattern, distance between the cells can be specified.
Bricks::
  Fills the object using a brick pattern, angles and bricks' heights can be specified.
Weaving::
  Fills the object using a weaving pattern, angles and spacing can be specified.
Symbol::
  Fills the object using a special symbol chosen from a list, distance between symbols can be specified.
Image::
  You can specify location of image on the local disc. The image is repeated periodically, its size is fixed in pixels
  and top left corner is aligned to the top left corner of the view.

[NOTE]

====

You can also check the _Inverse filling_ box to fill with the selected pattern the whole
image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_, except the selected
object.
