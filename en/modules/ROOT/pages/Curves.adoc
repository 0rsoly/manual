= Curves

GeoGebra supports the following types of curves:

== [#Parametric_curves]#Parametric curves#

Parametric curves of the form _a(t)_ = _(f(t), g(t))_ where _t_ is real parameter within a certain range can be created:

* using the xref:/commands/Curve_Command.adoc[Curve Command] or
* by typing their expression directly in the _input bar_, e.g.`++(t^2,t^3)++`.

Parametric curves can be used as arguments in the following commands: xref:/commands/Tangent_Command.adoc[Tangent],
xref:/commands/Point_Command.adoc[Point], xref:/commands/Intersect_Command.adoc[Intersect],
xref:/commands/Derivative_Command.adoc[Derivative], xref:/commands/Length_Command.adoc[Length],
xref:/commands/Curvature_Command.adoc[Curvature], xref:/commands/CurvatureVector_Command.adoc[CurvatureVector] and
xref:/commands/OsculatingCircle_Command.adoc[OsculatingCircle].

[NOTE]
====

* Parametric curves can be used with pre-defined functions and arithmetic operations. For example, input `++c(3)++`
returns the point at parameter position 3 on curve _c_.
* You can also place a point on a curve using tool image:24px-Mode_point.svg.png[Mode point.svg,width=24,height=24]
xref:/tools/Point_Tool.adoc[Point] or command xref:/commands/Point_Command.adoc[Point]. Since the endpoints _a_ and _b_
are dynamic you can use slider variables as well (see tool image:24px-Mode_slider.svg.png[Mode
slider.svg,width=24,height=24] xref:/tools/Slider_Tool.adoc[Slider]).

====

Creating a parametric curve through some given points is not possible. You can however try e.g.
xref:/commands/FitPoly_Command.adoc[FitPoly Command] to get a function going through these points.

== [#Polar_curves]#Polar curves#

In order to draw a curve defined using polar coordinates, it is possible to use one of the following (equivalent)
syntaxes:

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++ρ=sin(2 θ)++`, or `++sin(2 θ)++`, or `++f(t)=(sin(2*t); t)++`, or `++(sin(2*t); t)++`, or
`++f(t)=(sin(2*t); t), 0< t < pi++`, or `++(sin(2*t); t), 0 < t < pi++`, or `++Curve[(sin(2*t); t), t, 0, 2pi]++`.

====

== [#Implicit_curves]#Implicit curves#

Implicit curves are polynomials in variables _x_ and _y_. The can be entered directly using the
xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[Input Bar]. The xref:/commands/ImplicitCurve_Command.adoc[ImplicitCurve] command generates an
implicit curve through a list of points.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++x^4 + y^3 = 2xy++`
