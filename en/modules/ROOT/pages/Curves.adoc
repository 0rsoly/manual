GeoGebra supports the following types of curves:

== Parametric curves

Parametric curves of the form _a(t)_ = _(f(t), g(t))_ where _t_ is real parameter within a certain range can be created:

* using the xref:/commands/Curve.adoc[Curve Command] or
* by typing their expression directly in the _input bar_, e.g.`++(t^2,t^3)++`.

Parametric curves can be used as arguments in the following commands: xref:/commands/Tangent.adoc[Tangent],
xref:/commands/Point.adoc[Point], xref:/commands/Intersect.adoc[Intersect], xref:/commands/Derivative.adoc[Derivative],
xref:/commands/Length.adoc[Length], xref:/commands/Curvature.adoc[Curvature],
xref:/commands/CurvatureVector.adoc[CurvatureVector] and xref:/commands/OsculatingCircle.adoc[OsculatingCircle].

[NOTE]
====

* Parametric curves can be used with pre-defined functions and arithmetic operations. For example, input `++c(3)++`
returns the point at parameter position 3 on curve _c_.
* You can also place a point on a curve using tool image:24px-Mode_point.svg.png[Mode point.svg,width=24,height=24]
xref:/tools/Point.adoc[Point] or command xref:/commands/Point.adoc[Point]. Since the endpoints _a_ and _b_ are dynamic
you can use slider variables as well (see tool image:24px-Mode_slider.svg.png[Mode slider.svg,width=24,height=24]
xref:/tools/Slider.adoc[Slider]).

====

Creating a parametric curve through some given points is not possible. You can however try e.g.
xref:/commands/FitPoly.adoc[FitPoly Command] to get a function going through these points.

== Polar curves

In order to draw a curve defined using polar coordinates, it is possible to use one of the following (equivalent)
syntaxes:

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++ρ=sin(2 θ)++`, or `++sin(2 θ)++`, or `++f(t)=(sin(2*t); t)++`, or `++(sin(2*t); t)++`, or
`++f(t)=(sin(2*t); t), 0< t < pi++`, or `++(sin(2*t); t), 0 < t < pi++`, or `++Curve[(sin(2*t); t), t, 0, 2pi]++`.

====

== Implicit curves

Implicit curves are polynomials in variables _x_ and _y_. The can be entered directly using the
xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[Input Bar]. The xref:/commands/ImplicitCurve.adoc[ImplicitCurve] command generates an implicit
curve through a list of points.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++x^4 + y^3 = 2xy++`
