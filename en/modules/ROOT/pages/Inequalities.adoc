= Inequalities

GeoGebra supports inequalities in one or two variables. There are no limitations for inequalities to appear in
image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Algebra_View.adoc[Algebra View],
but only specific inequalities can be drawn in image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View]:

* polynomial inequalities in one variable, e.g. _x^3 > x + 1_ or _y^2>y_,
* quadratic inequalities in two variables, e.g. _x^2 + y^2 + x*y ≤ 4_,
* inequalities linear in one variable, e.g. _2x > sin(y)_ or _y < sqrt(x)_.

For inequality sign you can use <, >, ≤, ≥. The Symbols <= and => also valid. Conjunction and disjunction are also
supported for inequalities, e.g. _(x>y)&&(x+y<3)_ can be drawn.

In order to show the solution of an inequality as one or more intervals on the x-axis, select the _Show on x-axis_
option in the _Style_ tab of the image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16]
xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties dialog] of the inequality. (This does not work with every inequality.)

Inequalities are similar to functions. You can test whether _x_ and _y_ satisfy inequality _a_ by typing `++a(x,y)++` in
the xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[Input Bar], also when _A_ is a point, syntax `++a(A)++` is valid. A point can be restricted to
the region given by inequality using xref:/commands/PointIn_Command.adoc[PointIn Command]. For inequality _b_ in one
variable, e.g. in _x_, `++Point(b)++` yields a point restricted to the part of x-axis which satisfies inequality _b_.
