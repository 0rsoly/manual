== [#Types_of_Geometric_Objects]#Types of Geometric Objects#

GeoGebra works with many types of geometric objects

* xref:/Points_and_Vectors.adoc[Points and Vectors]
* xref:/Lines_and_Axes.adoc[Lines and Axes]
* xref:/Conic_sections.adoc[Conic sections and Arcs]
* xref:/Functions.adoc[Functions]
* xref:/Curves.adoc[Curves]
* xref:/Inequalities.adoc[Inequalities]
* xref:/Intervals.adoc[Intervals]
== [#Paths]#Paths#

Lists of points, loci, and some of the above mentioned objects (lines, conic sections, arcs, polygons, functions, single
variable inequalities, intervals) are referred to as _paths_. One can define a xref:/Points_and_Vectors.adoc[point] to
belong to a path using the xref:/commands/Point_Command.adoc[Point Command]. Each point on a path has a path parameter,
which is a number ranging from 0 to 1. To get this parameter, you can use the
xref:/commands/PathParameter_Command.adoc[PathParameter Command].

[NOTE]
====

xref:/Lists.adoc[Lists] of other paths are also paths.

== [#Regions]#Regions#

You can also restrict points to a _region_ (polygon, conic, arc, two variable inequality) using the
xref:/commands/PointIn_Command.adoc[PointIn Command] or image:24px-Mode_pointonobject.svg.png[Mode
pointonobject.svg,width=24,height=24] xref:/tools/Point_on_Object_Tool.adoc[Point on Object Tool].
