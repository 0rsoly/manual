= Conditional Visibility

Apart from just showing or hiding certain objects you can also have their visibility status depend on a certain
condition. For example, you would like an object to appear on screen if you check a checkbox positioned in the
image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View]
or if a xref:/tools/Slider_Tool.adoc[slider] is changed to a certain value.

You can use the image:24px-Mode_showcheckbox.svg.png[Mode showcheckbox.svg,width=24,height=24]
xref:/tools/Check_Box_Tool.adoc[Check Box Tool] in order to create a checkbox that controls the visibility of one or
more existing objects on screen.

Alternatively, you could also create a xref:/Boolean_values.adoc[Boolean variable] (e.g. `b = true`) using the
xref:/Input_Bar.adoc[Input Bar] and make it visible as a checkbox in the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_ by changing its visibility status (e.g. use
image:24px-Mode_showhideobject.svg.png[Mode showhideobject.svg,width=24,height=24]
xref:/tools/Show_/_Hide_Object_Tool.adoc[Show / Hide Object Tool] or the xref:/Context_Menu.adoc[Context Menu]). A
checkbox therefore is a visible _Boolean variable_. In order to use this Boolean variable as a condition for the
visibility of certain objects, you need to follow the steps described below.

In the image:16px-Menu-options.svg.png[Menu-options.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Properties_Dialog.adoc[Properties
Dialog], you can enter a condition for the visibility of an object on tab _Advanced_.

[NOTE]

====

You can select the xref:/Boolean_values.adoc[logic operators] (e.g. ≠, ≥, ˄, ‖) from list to the right of the input
field in order to create your conditional statements.

[EXAMPLE]

====

* If a is a slider, then the conditional statement a < 2 means that the corresponding object is only shown in the
image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] _Graphics View_ if the slider value is
less than 2.
* If b is a Boolean variable, you can use b as a conditional statement. The corresponding object is shown whenever the
value of b is true and is hidden when the value of b is false.
* If g and h are two lines and you would like a text to be shown whenever these lines are parallel, then you could use g
‖ h as a conditional statement for the text.
