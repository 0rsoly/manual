* Select two points in the _xOy plane_ to obtain a cube lying on that plane.
* Select two points on the same side of _z=c_ to obtain a cube lying on the plane having _z=c_ as one of its equations.
* Select a plane and two points on this plane, or on a parallel plane, to obtain a cube lying on the last plane.
