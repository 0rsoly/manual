Asymptote( <Conic> )::
  Yields both asymptotes of the conic.
  +
  [.block-content]#*Example:* `Asymptote(x^2 - y^2 /4 = 1)` returns line
  _-2x + y = 0_ and line _-2x - y = 0_.#

Asymptote( <Function> )::
  GeoGebra will attempt to find the asymptotes of the function and
  return them in a list. It may not find them all, for example vertical
  asymptotes of non-rational functions such as ln(x). *This syntax is
  not available in the Graphing and Geometry Apps*
  +
  [.block-content]#*Example:*
  `Asymptote((x^3 - 2x^2 - x + 4) / (2x^2 - 2))` returns the list _\{y =
  0.5x - 1, x = 1, x = -1}_.#

Asymptote( <Implicit Curve> )::
  Yields a list containing all the asymptotes of the Implicit Curve.
  +
  [.block-content]#*Example:* `Asymptote(x^3 + y^3 + y^2 - 3 x = 0)`
  returns the list _\{x + y = -0.33}_.#
