= Area Command

Area( <Point>, ..., <Point> )::
  Calculates the area of the polygon defined by the given points.
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* `Area((0, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (0, 2))` yields _6_.

====

Area( <Conic> )::
  Calculates the area of a conic section (circle or ellipse).
  +

[EXAMPLE]

====

*Example:* `Area(x^2 + y^2 = 2)` yields _6.28_.

====

Area( <Polygon> )::
  Calculates the area of the polygon.

[NOTE]

====

*Notes:*

* for Polygons, the absolute value of the Algebraic Area is calculated (which gives unexpected answers for
self-intersecting polygons)
* In order to calculate the area between two function graphs, you need to use the command
